      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&#39;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&#39;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&#39;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&#39;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration I chose the datasets, Suicide and GBSG2, as they gave the suicide rates and Breast Cancer data in Germany, respectively. The variables included in the Suicide dataset include sex, age, and methods for committing suicide. The Breast Cancer dataset includes tumor size, age, survival time, and more variables. I combined them by age to see the effect of age on these various variables. I am not entirely sure whether there will be associations with age groups that have greater cancer rates and higher rates of suicide, but this association is certainly highly possible.</description>

The germany_age dataset is composed of 13 variables and 2394 observations, and it has data on suicide rates in Germany based on age, sex, and method of suicide. It also contains data from a breast cancer study in Germany, and the data are combined to be compared by age.</description>
